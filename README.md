***Never get lost again! Find True North reliably using the oldest navigation tool: the Sun! Solar Compass is also your essential companion for accurate DAYTIME POLAR ALIGNMENT of your equatorial telescope mount.**

Solar Compass turns your Android device into a simple yet powerful tool for determining True North without relying on the often-unreliable magnetic sensors found in phones. Perfect for hikers, boaters, campers, survival enthusiasts, educators, **astrophotographers setting up during the day**, or anyone curious about traditional navigation methods.

**How It Works:**

This app leverages proven astronomical calculations using the highly accurate Astronomy Engine library. The Sun's position in the sky (its Azimuth angle) changes predictably based on your precise geographic location (latitude and longitude) and the exact date and time. Solar Compass:

1. Obtains your location automatically via your device's GPS (permission required).
2. Uses the current date and time from your device.
3. Calculates the Sun's precise Azimuth (its direction relative to True North) and Altitude.
4. Displays a clear compass dial with:
  - Standard N, E, S, W markings and degree ticks.
  - Subtle N-S and E-W axis lines for visual reference.
  - A **Red Line:** Indicating the direction where the Sun's shadow *should* be pointing (calculated as 180 degrees opposite the Sun's current azimuth).
5. Includes an on-screen **Bubble Level** using device sensors to help you hold your phone perfectly flat for maximum accuracy.

**How to Use for General Navigation (Finding True North):**

1. **Grant Permission:** Allow location access when prompted (required for calculations).
2. **Ensure Sunlight:** You need a clear view of the Sun to cast a distinct shadow.
3. **Use Level Indicator:** Place your phone on a surface and tilt it until the bubble in the on-screen level indicator is centered. This ensures the phone is flat.
4. **Vertical Pointer:** Place a thin, straight object (like a stylus, thin rod, pencil, or plumb line) vertically at the exact center of the compass dial.
5. **Observe Shadow:** Note the shadow cast by the vertical object.
6. **Align Shadow:** **Carefully rotate your entire phone** (while keeping it flat) until the object's shadow aligns perfectly with the **Red Line** (Shadow Direction marker) on the screen.
7. **Find North:** Once the shadow is perfectly aligned with the red line, the **"N"** marking on the compass dial screen points directly towards **True North**.

**How to Use for Daytime Polar Alignment (Astrophotography):**

Accurate polar alignment is crucial for long-exposure astrophotography, and achieving it during the day saves valuable nighttime imaging hours. Solar Compass makes this much easier:

1. **Level Your Mount:** Ensure your equatorial mount's tripod and base are perfectly level.
2. **Set Mount Latitude:** Adjust the mount's altitude axis precisely to your current geographic latitude.
3. **Find True North with Solar Compass:** Follow the general navigation steps above (Steps 1-7) near your mount setup. Use the level indicator for best results.
4. **Mark North:** Identify a distant landmark or place a temporary marker on the ground in the exact direction of True North indicated by the app.
5. **Align Mount Azimuth:** Carefully adjust the azimuth (left/right) rotation of your mount base. Sight along the mount's polar axis (RA axis) and align it precisely with your True North reference mark/landmark. Use your mount's azimuth adjustment knobs for fine-tuning.
6. **Initial Alignment Complete:** Your mount is now accurately polar aligned for daytime observation or as an excellent starting point for nighttime refinement (e.g., using drift alignment or plate solving).

**Key Features:**

- Accurate Sun Azimuth & Altitude calculation using Astronomy Engine.
- Determines **True North** (Geographic North).
- **Integrated Bubble Level** for precise device orientation.
- Automatic location input via GPS (permission required).
- Simple, easy-to-read compass interface with clear Shadow Direction indicator (Red Line).
- Dedicated instructions for **Daytime Polar Alignment** for equatorial mounts (like ZWO AM5, Sky-Watcher EQ6-R, etc.).
- Works offline once location is established (calculations are done locally).
- Lightweight and battery-friendly.

**Ideal For:**

- **Astrophotographers:** Performing accurate daytime polar alignment.
- Outdoor activities: Hiking, backpacking, camping, boating, fishing.
- Survival situations.
- Educational purposes: Teaching navigation, astronomy.
- Anyone needing to orient themselves or align objects to True North.

**Important Notes:**

- This app finds **TRUE NORTH**, which differs from Magnetic North.
- Requires direct sunlight for the shadow method.
- Accuracy depends on level device/mount, vertical pointer, and precise shadow alignment.
- Location permission (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`) is required for the App to function.
- Sensor data (Accelerometer/Magnetometer) is used only for the level indicator.
- Your privacy is important. Location and sensor data are processed locally on your device for calculations only and are not stored or transmitted. Please see our Privacy Policy for details.
