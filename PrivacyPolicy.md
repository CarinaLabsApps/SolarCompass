**Privacy Policy for Solar Compass**

**Effective Date:** April 27, 2025

**1. Introduction**

This Privacy Policy describes how Carina Labs ("Developer", "we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use the Solar Compass mobile application ("App"). Your privacy is important to us. This App is designed to use minimal data necessary for its core functionality.

**2. Information We Collect**

To provide its features, the App collects or accesses the following types of information:

* **Precise Location Data:** If you grant permission (`android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`), the App accesses your device's precise geographic location (latitude and longitude) via GPS provided by your device's operating system and Google Play Services. Location data is essential for calculating the Sun's position.
* **Sensor Data (Accelerometer & Magnetometer):** The App accesses data from your device's **Accelerometer** and **Magnetometer** sensors. This sensor data is used solely to determine the current orientation (pitch and roll) of your device for the **level indicator feature**. This feature helps you hold the device flat for more accurate shadow alignment.

**3. How We Use Information**

The information collected is used solely for the App's core functionality, processed locally on your device:

* **Location Data:** Your latitude, longitude, and the current time are used to calculate the Sun's current azimuth (direction), enabling the determination of True North via the shadow alignment method.
* **Sensor Data:** Accelerometer and Magnetometer data is used only to calculate the device's tilt (pitch and roll) and display the on-screen level indicator. This data is not used for tracking user activity or any other purpose.

**4. Data Sharing**

We **do not share** your Precise Location Data, Sensor Data, or any other personal information with any third parties. All calculations involving your location and sensor data occur directly on your device.

**5. Data Storage and Retention**

We **do not store** your Precise Location Data or Sensor Data.

* Location information is used only for the immediate calculation required when the App is active and is discarded afterwards.
* Sensor data is processed in real-time for the level indicator display and is not saved on your device by the App or transmitted elsewhere.

**6. Permissions Used**

The App requests the following permission:

* **`android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`:** This permission is required *only* if you choose to use the automatic "Use GPS" feature to determine your location. The App remains functional using manual location entry even if this permission is denied *(Self-correction: We removed manual entry, so this permission is essential for the app's core function now)*. **This permission is required for the App's core functionality.**

*(Note: Access to Accelerometer and Magnetometer typically does not require explicit runtime permissions beyond what's granted at install time if the hardware feature is declared or implicitly required).*

**7. Third-Party Services**

The App utilizes standard operating system features and Google Play Services to access location data when the GPS feature is enabled. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for information on how they handle data.

**8. User Rights**

You have control over your information:

* **Location Permission:** You can grant or revoke the Location permission at any time through your device's settings. **Revoking this permission will prevent the App from functioning**, as location is required for its calculations.
* **Uninstall:** You can stop all information collection by the App by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device.

**9. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on its Google Play Store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
